## üê¥ How to Use

**RPGHorse** allows players to summon and level up horses, giving them RPG-style abilities. Here's how you can get started:

### 1. **Summon a Horse**

To summon a **Basic Horse**, you need to obtain a special **Saddle**:

- Use the `/give` command to get a **Basic Horse Saddle**:
  ```plaintext
  /give <player> rpghorse:saddle

 ### 2. **Leveling Up Your Horse**

 As you ride your horse, it will accumulate distance traveled. Every time your horse travels 500 blocks, it will level up. Upon leveling up, the horse's stats (such as speed and jump power) will improve.

 - **Level Cap**: The horse's level is capped at level 20
